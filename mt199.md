- Field: 21 -  Mandatory - Description: Related Reference (contains the reference of the transaction to which the charge(s), interest and/or other expense(s) in this message apply, for example, field 20 Transaction Reference Number of the related message) - Min Textbox Length: 1 - Max Textbox Length: 16 - Max number of textboxes: 1
  
- Field: 79 -  Optional - Description: Narrative Description of the Original Message (contains a narrative description of the original message, or single transaction within a multiple message, which will enable the Receiver to positively identify the message or transaction to be cancelled.

# SWIFT Financial Application (FIN) message structure

## Messages have the following structure:

{1: Basic Header Block} {2: Application Header Block} {3: User Header Block} {4: Text Block or body} {5: Trailer Block}

These five SWIFT message blocks include header information, the body of the message, and a trailer. All blocks have the same basic format: {n: ...}. The curly braces ({}) indicate the beginning and end of a block.

n is the block identifier, in this case a single integer between 1 and 5. Each block identifier is associated with a particular part of the message. There is no carriage return or line feed (CRLF) between blocks.

Blocks 3, 4, and 5 may contain sub-blocks or fields delimited by field tags. Block 3 is optional. Many applications, however, populate block 3 with a reference number so that when SWIFT returns the acknowledgement, it can be used for reconciliation purposes.


## {1: Basic Header Block}


The basic header block is fixed-length and continuous with no field delimiters. It has the following format:

{(a)1:    (b)F    (c)01   (d)CIBCCATTAXXX   (e)2222   (f)123456}
 

a)
1: = Block ID (always 1)


b)
Application ID as follows:
F = FIN (financial application) Note:  We will opt for this option while creating EnI MT messages
A = GPA (general purpose application)
L = GPA (for logins, and so on)


c)
Service ID as follows:
01 = FIN/GPA  Note:  We will opt for this option while creating EnI MT messages
21 = ACK/NAK


d)
CIBCCATTAXXX = Logical terminal (LT) address. It is fixed at 12 characters; 8 character BIC code with 9th character other than  X followed by branch code. This has the sender's BIC (this will have the BIC of the bank where we implement our solution) with additional 9th character as Non-X character.


e)
2222 = Session number. It is generated by the user's computer and is padded with zeros.


f)
123456 = Sequence number that is generated by the user's computer. It is padded with zeros.



## {2: Application Header Block}
 

There are two types of application headers:

Input (Input to SWIFT) and Output (Output from SWIFT). Both are fixed-length and continuous with no field delimiters.

Note: When EnI creates a message it will be sent to SWIFT, hence it is considered as Input message.

The input (to SWIFT) structure is as follows:

{(a)2:    (b)I     (c)192    (d)ICICINBBXXXX    (e)N       (f)2       (g)020}
                                                 


a)
2: = Block ID (always 2)
 

b)
I = Input
 

c)
192 = Message type (E.g. 192, 195, 196 etc.)
 

d)
ICICINBBXXXX = Receiver's BIC with additional X in position 9 before 3 character branch code. It is padded with Xs if no branch code is available.
 

e)
N = Normal  Note:  We will opt for this option while creating EnI MT messages


## {4: Text Block or body}
 

This block is where the actual message content is specified and is what most users see. Generally the other blocks are stripped off before presentation. The format, which is variable length and requires use of CRLF as a field delimiter, is as follows:

{4:
:20:1234567890123456
:21:6543210987654321
:79:Please provide the status of the pending transaction referenced in MT 202 dated 01-Jul-2024.
-}

Note: This is an example of MT199.
